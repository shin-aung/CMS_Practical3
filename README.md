**Learning Activities & Resources**


I created my own WordPress website after watching a helpful tutorial on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMVEzg82pnU&t=970s). The tutorial gave me useful tips and a step-by-step guide, and I learned a lot from it.

All the images on my website are from Google Images (https://www.google.com), and I made sure to use them in compliance with open-source rules. They really enhance the look of my website, and I'm quite happy with the outcome. If you're curious about how I built my website or have any questions, feel free to ask!

To host my WordPress website on the internet, I use a service called Infinity Free (https://www.infinityfree.com). While I'm aware that Infinity Free isn't the most secure platform, I followed instructions from this YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMTNsvS_Jb4) to add an SSL certificate and improve the security of my site.


**Estimated Hours**


I invested around 10 hours in completing my WordPress project, drawing on my previous experience to navigate through the assignment. Despite becoming more familiar with WordPress during the task, I encountered a few issues that needed attention. Post-assignment, I remained friendly with WordPress but continued to face challenges.

To ensure a polished and user-friendly website, I delved into various tutorials and experimented with different elements. These efforts were crucial in shaping the site to align with my vision and objectives. Setting up the SSL certificate took some additional time, but it was a necessary step to enhance the security of my website. Overall, the 10 hours I spent were a valuable investment in acquiring the skills needed for successful website creation.

**Why do I use infinity free although it is not a secure platform to host the website?**


I chose to use Infinity Free to host my website despite its lack of inherent security for a couple of reasons:

Cost Efficiency: Infinity Free provides hosting services for free, which aligns with my budget constraints. As I'm still in the initial stages of managing my website, the cost efficiency offered by Infinity Free allows me to allocate resources to other aspects of website development.
Learning Opportunity: Infinity Free allows me to experiment and learn more about website hosting without a financial commitment. It serves as a practical environment for me to understand the dynamics of hosting, troubleshoot issues, and implement solutions.
However, I am aware of the security limitations on Infinity Free. To address this concern, I took proactive steps to enhance the security of my website by following a tutorial to apply an SSL certificate. While it doesn't make the platform entirely secure, it adds an extra layer of protection to my website.

In the future, as my website grows and if budget allows, I might consider migrating to a more secure hosting platform. For now, Infinity Free serves as a starting point for my online presence, offering a balance between cost-effectiveness and the opportunity to learn.
